# Brazilian Sign Language Alphabet Recognition

Project developed for the Computer Vision course taken in 2022/1 at the Department of Computer Science at UFMG. It consists of building a recognition system for the Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) alphabet to Latin letters using images. The system was built using OpenCV and PyTorch.
